# geogram

Geogram is a programming library with geometric algorithms.
It contains the main results in Geometry Processing from the former
ALICE Inria project, that is, more than 30 research articles published
in ACM SIGGRAPH, ACM Transactions on Graphics, Symposium on Geometry 
Processing and Eurographics. It was supported by two grants from the
European Research Council (ERC): GOODSHAPE and VORPALINE.


Geogram includes a simple yet efficient Mesh data structure (for surfacic
and volumetric meshes), exact computer arithmetics (a-la Shewchuck,
implemented in GEO::expansion ), a predicate code generator (PCK :
Predicate Construction Kit), standard geometric predicates
(orient/insphere), Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi diagram, spatial
search data structures, spatial sorting) and less standard ones (more
general geometric predicates, intersection between a Voronoi diagram
and a triangular or tetrahedral mesh embedded in n dimensions), and 
semi-discrete optimal transport.
